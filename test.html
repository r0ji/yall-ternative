    <h1>Howdy, y'all!</h1>
    <p>Y'all are trying out a Chrome extension that replaces "y'all" with "you all". Let's see how it works.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Y'all should notice that this line is affected.</li>
        <li>But y'all should also note that this line is affected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If y'all see "you all" instead of "y'all", then the extension is working properly!</p>
